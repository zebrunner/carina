* Carina framework is built on top of the most popular open-source solutions like Selenium, Appium, TestNG allowing to reduce dependence on the specific technology stack.

* Carina supports all popular browsers (IE, Safari, Chrome, Firefox) and mobile devices (iOS/Android). A special feature for a mobile domain: it reuses test automation code between IOS/Android up to 70-80%.

* As far as our framework is built in Java, it is cross-platform. Tests may be easily executed both on Unix or Windows OS. All you need is JDK 11 installed.

* The framework supports different types of databases - both relational and nonrelational (MySQL, SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL), providing amazing experience of DAO layer implementation using MyBatis ORM framework.

* API testing is based on a Freemarker template engine. It enables great flexibility in generating REST requests, and responses are dynamically changed by incoming arguments.


Carina is fully integrated into [Zebrunner Starter Kit](https://github.com/qaprosoft/qps-infra) that helps to setup a production-ready environment for running Mobile, Web and API tests. Feel free to ask any questions if you are going to use it in your company.
